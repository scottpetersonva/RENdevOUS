# RENdevOUS

This app allows developers to save articles that they find useful.  Bookmarks are boring and often do not give the user a description of the article saved.  RENdevOUS is visually appealing and gives the user an array of information about an article by simply saving a link.  Each user is given a unique dashboard given them a personalized experience.
